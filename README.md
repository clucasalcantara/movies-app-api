## TMDB GraphQL API Example

## Getting Started

First, configure the ENV file adding a .env following the env.example. (NOTE: If you don't specify a port the API will be running on the 3001 port)

After that you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001/graphql](http://localhost:3001/graphql) with your browser to see the graphiQL interface.

All the docs are added in the GraphiQL environment.
